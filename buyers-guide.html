                    you are a known account
                    holder with satisfactory record, it is easier for the banker to assess your credit worthiness.

                    enter into a new bank branch just for the home loan. If you chose reputed Real Estate Company or

                    the
                    reason why banks collect processing fee upfront. You need to pay fee while submitting the
                    application
                    itself. Processing fee Varies from bank to bank. It is normally around 0.25% to 0.50% of the
                    total
                    loan
                    amount. For example, if you take 10 lakh loans, you will have to pay around Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000
                    as
                    processing fee. Some banks may charge fixed amount which is ranging from Rs. 5,000 to 10,000. On
                    special
                    occasion banks usually waive the processing fee. </p>
                <p class="description">Some banks may not charge processing fee upfront. But look out… You may need
                    to pay legal
                    charges or
                    administrative fees.As far as possible, pick best residential properties from reputed builder.
                    Their
                    properties will normally be approved by the bankers. Bankers offer loans on easier terms and
                    offer
                    discount in processing fee. You may get loans with cheaper rates also</p>

                <h5>SUBMISSION OF PROPERTY DOCUMENTS</h5>
                <p class="description"> You are required to hand over the entire set of original documents
                    pertaining to
                    your property to
                    the
                    bank. Again, if you have chosen a reputed builders property, and the property is approved on
                    this
                    may
                    not be necessary, as the banker already in possession of the above said documents. Otherwise,

                <h5> TECHNICAL EVALUATION</h5>
                <p class="description"> Banks will send an expert to visit the premises you intend to purchase.
                    Normally
                    this job is done
                    by
                    Civil Engineer or an Architect. Some banks may send senior employees to evaluate the property.
                    The
                    main
                    aim of this evaluation process is to ascertain the quality of construction. If the property is
                    under
                    construction, to determine the stage of construction is the same as that mentioned in the
                    payment
                    notice
                    issued to you by the builder. Banker also tries to confirm Layout of flats and area of property
                    is
                    within permissions granted by the concerning local body.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h5>VALUATIONS</h5>
                <p class="description"> Banks carry out an independent valuation to determine whether purchase is in
                    line with the existing
                    market price of the area where property exists. Valuation is the key yardstick in determining
                    the
                    loan
                    amount that can be sanctioned by the bank. The valuation issue rarely arises when property in
                    Hyderabad
                    is purchased from a reputed builder and the residential apartment is pre approved one.</p>

                <h5>SIGNING THE HOME LOAN AGREEMENT </h5>
                <p class="description">You are required to enter in to a tripartite agreement with the builder,
                    banker.
                    <br/>
                    You also need to submit post-dated cheques for the first 36 months if you agree for this mode of
                    repayment. This agreement will contain a condition binding on the builder to hand over the
                    documents
                    after the registration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">

                <p class="description">After the legal scrutiny and technical verification and evaluation the draft
                    documents as cleared by
                    the
                    lawyer need to register with the Sub Registrar. Registration fee and the relevant charges are to
                    be
                    borne by you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h5>DISBURSEMENT</h5>
                <p class="description"> Banks typically finance up to 80-85 percent of the property value. That
                    means
                    you have to
                    contribute at
                    least 15 percent of the property value from your own funds. In banking parlance, it is called
                    the
                    Margin. Registration charges and the cost for interior decoration may be considered the part of
                    the
                    property value. Before commencing disbursal you need to submit documents to prove that you have
                    paid
                    the
                    margin money. Many of you may need to withdraw moneys from Provident fund. It may take a while
                    to
                    receive money from PF Authorities. </p>
                <p class="description">If that is the case, you need to provide sufficient evidence for the same. It
                    is only after
                    submitting
                    this proof that the bank will release part-disbursement of the loan. Directly to the builder. So
                    the
                    cheque will be in the name of the builder. . </p>
                <p class="description">Usually, loans are disbursed on the basis of the stage of construction of the
                    residential
                    apartment.
                    In
                    case of resale or ready to occupy properties, the disbursement is full and final. </p>
                <p class="description">In case of part disbursal, the bank does not start to deduct Equated Monthly
                    Instalment (EMI)s
                    immediately. Since the EMI is calculated on the total loan amount at a particular rate of
                    interest
                    and
                    for a given tenure. Banks charge simple interest on the partly disbursed loan amount. For
                    instance,
                    if
                    you have a sanctioned loan of Rs 25 lakh but the property is under construction and the bank has
                    disbursed only Rs. 10 lakh only, , you will be charged a simple interest only on the 10 lakh
                    only.
                </p>
                <p class="description">This continues until the final disbursement is done. The simple interest paid
                    is called Pre-EMI
                    interest
                    or Pre-EMI. For Pre-EMI payments, banks may take only around six to 24 post-dated cheques.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h4>HOW MUCH LOAN AM I ELIGIBLE FOR? </h4>
                <p class="description">How much Home Loan can I get? Is the bank lending me required amount? What are
                    the
                    criteria for
                    arriving
                    at the loan amount? Is there any way out to receive required amount? Will I be proud owner of high
                    quality class flat? Your worries will be addressed here. </p>
                <p class="description">Loan eligibility is based on two important parameters. </p>
                <p class="description">1. Your financial strength or repayment ability. That means, amount of Equated
                    Monthly Instalment
                    (EMI)
                    you can afford. </p>
                <p class="description">2. Value of the property and the percentage of the margin.</p>

                <p class="description">You will get the lower of the two. For this percentage formula, some banks
                    consider your gross
                    salary
                    and some are considering net salary. However, most banks consider gross salary only.</p>
                <p class="description">By virtue of your higher income, you may be eligible for higher amount of home
                    loan. But banks will
                    not
                    sanction more than 80-85 per cent of the property value. Gone are days when 100 loans were
                    sanctioned
                    liberally.</p>
                <p class="description">Your capacity to repay the loan on equal monthly installments is based on your
                    Income and
                    Expenditure
                    habits… Normally, banks will decide the loan amount, so that the EMI is limited to 50-60 percent of
                    your
                    total Income. Take for example, your net monthly income is Rs. 25,000 and your regular monthly
                    expenditure is Rs. 15,000, banks assume that you can easily pay Rs. 10,000 towards EMI for your home
                    loan. </p>
                <p class="description">Now, some banks, i.e. State Bank of India is offering Home Loans at 8 percent
                    rate for the first
                    year.
                    If you have chosen 20 years term, at 8 percent EMI for one lakh will be Rs. 837. So bank will not
                    hesitate to sanction a loan of Rs. 11.94 lakh. </p>
                <p class="description">If the interest rate is 9 per cent EMI for one lakh will be Rs. 900. Then, your
                    maximum eligibility
                    will
                    be Rs. 11.11 lakh only. </p>
                <p class="description">Obviously, the higher the rate of interest, the lesser will be the loan amount.
                    Other way, the
                    higher
                    your income, the larger will be the loan eligibility. As mentioned earlier, it will not be more than
                    80-85 percent of the property value. </p>
                <p class="description">It is impossible to ascertain the level of expenditure for every individual. That
                    is the reason why
                    banks will have a pre determined percentage of income as being available for EMI payments. This is
                    based
                    on household expenditure data prepared by Central Government authorities. . For example, banks may
                    determine that if your income is Rs. 25,000 per month 40 percent of that (Rs. 12,500) is available
                    for
                    EMI payment. Based on this they calculate the eligibility amount. This percent will increase
                    directly in
                    proportion to your income. The rationale behind this approach is that, the people with higher income
                    should be able to spend higher percentage of their income for repayment of home loan. Hence, the
                    Home
                    Finance Company may have slabs given below.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h4>FOR INCOME UNTO </h4>
                <p class="description">Rs. 15, 000-19,999 35 per cent</p>
                <p class="description">Rs. 20,000- 24,999 40 per cent</p>
                <p class="description">Rs. 25,000-29,999 45 per cent</p>
                <p class="description">Rs. 30,000 and above 50 per cent</p>
                <p class="description">As per the above slab, if your monthly income is 28,000 your eligibility:</p>
                <p class="description">Amount available for EMI = 45 percent of 28,000 = 12,600</p>
                <p class="description">Loan eligibility at 8 percent interest rate = 12,600/837=15.05 lakh. </p>
                <p class="description">If your income is Rs. 50,000 Your loan eligibility will be calculated as
                    below</p>
                <p class="description">Amount eligible for EMI is 50 percent of Rs. 50,000 = 25,000</p>
                <p class="description">Loan eligibility at 8 percent interest rate is 25,000/837 = 29.86 lakh. </p>
                <p class="description">Loan Term also will have an impact on the eligibility. All the above examples are
                    for a term of 240
                    months. If you chose 18 months. </p>
                <p class="description">If your income is Rs. 50,000 amount available for EMIs is Rs. 25,000</p>
                <p class="description">EMI for one lakh at 8 percent rate is Rs. 956.</p>
                <p class="description">Loan eligibility will be 25,000/956 = 26.10 lakh</p>

                <p class="description">Are you a Non Resident Indian (NRI)? Your dream is to purchase a flat in a
                    beautiful
                    residential
                    apartment? You probably need a Home Loan. The following things should be considered before you go on
                    searching for right home loan offer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h4>WHO IS NON RESIDENT INDIAN? <br/></h4>
                <p class="description">First of all you must make sure of yourself whether NRI tag applies to you or
                    not.
                    Foreign Exchange
                    Management Act-FEMA recognizes you as the NRI the moment you steps on the foreign soil with an
                    intention
                    stay there. You are entitled to be a NRI if you are an Indian Citizen, holding valid Indian
                    passport.
                    You are staying in foreign soil for Business, Employment or for vocational purpose. This definition
                    applies to the Indian Citizens staying abroad for an uncertain duration.</p>
                <p class="description">Definition of NRI for Income Tax purpose depends on the duration of the persons
                    stay outside India.
                    But
                    in FEMA it depends on the intention stay outside India for an indefinite period. For Home Loan and
                    purchase of residential property in India purpose, these definitions will not have many implications
                    except during the first year. IT Act takes in to account the duration of stay abroad during that
                    financial year.</p>
                <p class="description">Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), who are residing outside India, are also
                    considered to be an NRI. To
                    get
                    recognized as a PIO either you or your parents/grand parents must been citizens of Independent
                    India.
                </p>
                <p class="description">Citizens of Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Iran are
                    not considered to be PIOs.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="row">
                <h4>WHAT CAN A NRI BUY? </h4>
                <p class="description">Non Resident Indians can purchase any immovable property in India except
                    agricultural
                    land, farm
                    house
                    and plantation. NRIs can also avail Home Loan to purchase property. </p>
                <p class="description">Though it it’s called NRI Home loan, it just like the loan offered to the
                    resident Indian in many
                    respects.Each bank will maintain a data base of approved places. NRIs working in places which are in
                    negative profile may not be able to get Home Loans.</p>
                <p class="description">1. In order to get loan, NRI must be a graduate. Educational Qualification may
                    not be a constraint
                    for
                    resident Indians.</p>
                <p class="description">2. Most of the Banks stipulate that the NRI should have a monthly income of $
                    2,000 per month. This
                    yard
                    stick may vary from bank to bank. </p>
                <p class="description">3. NRIs need to submit certain additional documents like copy of the passport, a

                    But NRIs should
                    repay
                    the loan through Non Resident External (NRE) or Non Resident Ordinary (NRO) account cheques only.
                </p>
                <p class="description">5. Resident Indians can avail loan for tenure up to a maximum of 240 months. But,
                    NRIs loan term is
                    180
                    months maximum. In fact some banks restrict it for 120 months only. Maximum term for NRI home loans
                    varies from bank to bank. </p>
                <p class="description">6. NRIs not based in India and they may not be in position to sign on all papers
                    and enter in to
                    agreements for the purchase of apartments in Hyderabad. So, they need to submit a power of attorney
                    to
                    get a housing loan. </p>
                <p class="description">7. NRIs may have to pay additional interest rate than the resident Indians.
                    Normally NRIs required to
                    pay
                    0.25 percent to 0.50 percent more.</p>

                    probability of
                    continuing
                    in abroad till the loan repaid also to be considered.</p>
